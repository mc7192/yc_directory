- **shadcn/ui**  
  Use this component library to quickly build UI elements with accessibility and design consistency. Import pre-built components and customize them with Tailwind CSS classes to fit your design needs.

- **Sanity**  
  Sanity acts as your content backend. Define your content schemas, manage your content in the Sanity Studio, and fetch content in your Next.js app using Sanity’s client libraries. It’s perfect for dynamic content and structured data.

- **Zod**  
  Use Zod to create schemas for your data models and validate incoming data at runtime. It integrates well with TypeScript, providing type inference and safe validation of user inputs or API responses.

- **NextAuth.js**  
  NextAuth simplifies adding authentication to your Next.js app. Configure providers like GitHub, handle sessions, and secure routes using its built-in API routes and React hooks for managing user state.

- **Lucide**  
  Lucide provides a set of beautiful SVG icons that you can import as React components. You can customize icon size, color, and stroke, making it easy to maintain consistent iconography throughout your app.
